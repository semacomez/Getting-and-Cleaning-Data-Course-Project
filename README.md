# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This respiratory involves analysis I done on Human Activity recognition dataset.

### Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones

### Files
`CodeBook.md` a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

`R_script` includes R code for preparing tiny data by following the 5 steps below:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

`df_final.txt` is the final data file.
